quickbite
=========

A faster way to add bookmarks to Del.icio.us. Written by Garrett Murray.

FEATURES
--------

* It's fast! Add a page to Del.icio.us without having to fill out any forms.
* If you select text on the page you're about to bookmark, it will automatically be added as
the notes for the mark.
* All bookmarks added with quickbite will be tagged "quickbite" allowing you to quickly view
everything you've added via this tool.

INSTALL
-------

* Add appropriate settings in `conf.php`
* Upload `quickbite` dir to your server somewhere
* Generate your bookmarklet by visiting the location you uploaded to + `/bookmarklet.php`
* DELETE OR RENAME THE `bookmarklet.php` FILE TO SOMETHING CRYPTIC! THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!

You're done!
